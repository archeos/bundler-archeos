Description: Bundler is a SfM system for unordered image collections
 Bundler takes a set of images, image features, and image matches as input,
 and produces a 3D reconstruction of camera and (sparse) scene geometry as
 output. The system reconstructs the scene incrementally, a few images at a
 time, using a modified version of the Sparse Bundle Adjustment package of
 Lourakis and Argyros as the underlying optimization engine. Bundler has been
 successfully run on many Internet photo collections, as well as more
 structured collections.
 .
 This package provide the inital 0.4 version with Pierre Moulon's additions
 from https://github.com/TheFrenchLeaf/Bundler.
